# Info

I can hardly be called an active book reader. In my entire life I have read about 5 books :)

Here I want to show you the most useful ones.

<div class="book-title">
	<h1 id="math_primer">3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development</h1>
	Fletcher Dunn
</div>
<div class="book">
	<img src="resources/profile/books/3d_math_primer.jpg" />
	<div>
		In 2020, I studied how 3D rendering works under the hood. This book explains all the nuances very clearly. The author smoothly starts with vectors, moving on to matrices, etc. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		To be honest, I haven't read the entire book. Somewhere from the middle, the whole educational part ends, and further only an example of use is described.

<div class="book-title">
	<h1 id="clear_code">Чистый код: создание, анализ и рефакторинг</h1>
	Martin Robert
</div>
<div class="book">
	<img src="resources/profile/books/clear_code.jpg" />
	<div>
		This is my first book I bought. As the name implies, it describes how to format the code correctly using the example of Java.
		The book contains a lot of examples with good and bad code that helps you learn from mistakes.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I disagree with the author in some opinions, but overall the book is very good. I recommend reading for newbies.

<div class="book-title">
	<h1 id="programming_vvedenie">Программирование: введение в профессию</h1>
	Andrey Stolyarov
</div>
<div class="book">
	<img src="resources/profile/books/programming_vvedenie.jpg" />
	<div>
		These volumes of books were gifted to me by programming teacher. This book describes in detail the work of the computer. Starting with the history of the creation of the first logical machines, first OS, processors, architectures, languages, etc.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I am currently in the process of reading the first volume. I highly recommend reading it for a deep knowledge of how does computers work.
